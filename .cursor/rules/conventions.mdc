# Coding Conventions and Standards

## Coding Standards
### Data & Models (Backend Readiness)
- **IDs**: Always use `String` type for IDs (UUID format). Never use `int`.
- **JSON Naming**: Use `snake_case` for JSON keys (e.g., `user_name`, `hire_date`).
- **Dart Naming**: Use `camelCase` for class properties (e.g., `userName`, `hireDate`).
- **Serialization**: All models must implement `fromJson` and `toJson`.

### Code Organization
- Use PascalCase for class names (e.g., TodoService, HomeViewModel).
- Use camelCase for variables and methods.
- All state in Services and viewmodels should use ValueNotifier.
- ViewModels must receive Services through constructor injection and forward their state with a getter.
- Views must use ValueListenableBuilder for state updates.
- Use comments sparingly and only when they add value.
- Prefer self-documenting code through descriptive naming.

- Feature Files:
  Simple feature (flat structure):
  - `{feature_name}/{name}_model.dart`
  - `{feature_name}/{name}_service.dart`
  - `{feature_name}/{name}_view_model.dart`
  - `{feature_name}/{name}_view.dart`

  Complex feature (with subdirectories):
  - Models: `{feature_name}/models/{name}.dart`
  - Services: `{feature_name}/services/{name}_service.dart`
  - ViewModels: `{feature_name}/viewmodels/{name}_view_model.dart`
  - Views: `{feature_name}/views/{name}_view.dart`

- Tests: should mirror the real file location but in the test folder.
